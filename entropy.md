##Geometric Progression
A geometric progression is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio. For example, the sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, ... is a geometric progression with common ratio 3. Similarly 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, ... is a geometric sequence with common ratio 1/2.

###Sum of GP
The sum of the first n terms of a geometric series is given by:
$$S_n = \frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r}$$
where a is the first term and r is the common ratio.
